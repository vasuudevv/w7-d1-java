Answer

1. List Interface is best suited since we have to Choose a random employee by picking a number between 0 and size()-1.

2. Set should be used since Collections that implement this interface don't allow the same element to be entered more than once.

3. Map is best-suited , where the keys are first names, and each value is a count of the number of employees with that first name.

4. For this situation Queue should be used to to add employees to the waiting list, and remove them using add() and remove() method.
